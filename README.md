# Covid-19-Vaccination-Monitoring-System (CVMS)

Software Overview:

This project is designed to simplify the COVID - 19 Vaccination process thatâ€™s running throughout the world. We are so busy in our daily lives right now that it becomes impossible to keep track of things. To address this issue, this project will keep track of COVID-19 Vaccination Date, Time & Slot, Place and real time statistics.

Process Model:

The CVMS system will be processed using the Iterative model. Iterative process starts with a simple implementation of a subset of the software requirements and iteratively enhances the evolving versions until the full system is implemented. At each iteration, design modifications are made and new functional capabilities are added. The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental).

Software Requirement: Requires basic software capacity and adequate processing power to support the project.

The project has following functionalities: Vaccination appointment function for end users. Real time vaccination status. Real time Covid-19 cases. Get-Support Window.
